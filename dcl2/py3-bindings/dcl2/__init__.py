        This creates a high-level wrapper around PlainDeadcomL2 and takes care of synchronization
        objects (mutex, condvar and functions operating on them), as well as file-like link
        handling (especially reading from it and feeding that data to processData function).

        `pipe` is an object representing a bidirectional communication link (OS pipe, serial port,
        â€¦) that contains the following methods:

          - pipe.read() reads a single byte from the link. If no bytes are available, it blocks.
            If link gets closed, it returns None
          - pipe.write(bytes) writes bytes to the link. Blocks until the operation is complete.
          - pipe.close() closes the link. Further pipe.write() functions will now be no-op and
            pipe.read() will stop blocking and return None.

        When an object is created from this class a "receive thread" will be started. This thread
        will read incoming bytes from the pipe and pass them to the library for processing.
        The `pipe` object must therefore work correctly in multithreaded environment.

        Rest of API of user-facing API of this class is the same as PlainDeadcomL2.
