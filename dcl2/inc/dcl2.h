 * @brief   DeadCom Layer 2
 *
 * This file defines interface of DeadCom Layer 2. DeadCom L2 is a library that provides reliable
 * datagram communication over unreliable byte-oriented link. Internally it uses protocol inspired
 * by HDLC to establish a symmetric communication channel. See docs of this repostiry for more info
 * on internal design and protocol specification.
 *
 * This library is designed to be used in multithreaded systems. Details of thread safety are
 * mentioned in docs of each relevant function
